            <strong>How much does it cost my restaurant client?</strong><br />
            There are no upfront fees for the restaurant. Setup and maintenance are on us. The restaurant will pay a service charge for orders that are placed online.

          <p class="info">
            <strong>Does the restaurant need to sign a contract to use your service?</strong><br />
            Cancel anytime, no penalties Zuppler Menus Programs have Pay As You Go Pricing Plans. There are no cancellation penalties or binding contracts to use our service. No Commitments. No Hassles. The restaurant will only need to sign up and agree to do business with us. This will give us permission to setup the restaurant's menu and provide our services.
          </p>          

          <p class="info">
            <strong>How will the restaurant receive the orders they get through their website?</strong><br />
            Every order placed will be sent via fax/email/web or POS. Restaurants also have the option to review their orders instantly through their Online Control Panel. Zuppler tracks all orders to make sure the restaurant receives EACH order ticket. For orders sent by fax or email, Zuppler will confirm that your staff received the order by sending an automated phone call to the restaurant. Zuppler's 24/7 Support Team will monitor and handle orders that are NOT confirmed. This is our "No Order Left Behind" Policy.

          <p class="info">
            <strong>How do I change the appearance of Zuppler content?</strong><br />
            
            Zuppler designers will work to apply your colors as a first step in our configuration process. So once you receive the integration instructions, the color palette is already there. Zuppler content is rendered directly on your website pages, no iframes, no hidden stuff, and this makes our service so great and flexible. You have total control over the Zuppler content appearence as you have for your entire website by simply editing your stylesheets. It's just a matter of identifying the element to be styled, and then override its appearance from your css. <br />
            A simple example for changing your prices style: <code>#zuppler-menu .item .price { font-size:16px }</code>
